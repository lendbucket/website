          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">CreditStrong offers two kinds of accounts: Installment and Revolving. These accounts are a fusion of a savings account and either a secured installment loan or a secured revolving line of credit.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">CreditStrong installment accounts are cash-secured installment loans for building your credit. </p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">When you open your installment account, the loan proceeds are originated by Austin Capital Bank and placed in a locked savings account, securing the loan. Each month, as you make payments, your activity is reported to the three major credit bureaus, building payment history that accounts for 35% of your FICO score.</p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">Just like any other conventional loan, each payment is divided into principal and interest, with the principal portion going towards paying down your loan balance and the interest being the cost we charge for the service. Click <a>here</a> to review our installment product pricing.  </p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">At the end of your term, the principal portion of your payments is returned to you minus any unpaid interest or fees. </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">When you open a Revolv account, Austin Capital Bank extends you a secured revolving line of credit at 0% utilization, increasing your total available credit and lowering your overall utilization.  </p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">Set an optional monthly payment at 0% interest to maximize the benefits of your Revolv account by adding usage and payment history to the line of credit, all while you build savings. </p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">Making three consecutive on-time payments of $10 or more will increase your total line of credit by $250, allowing your Revolv account to reach a maximum of $3,000. </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">Everyone’s credit profile is different, and knowing which account type is best can be hard, but here’s a quick guide on what you need to consider: </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              If your credit is being hurt by high credit card balances, <a>Revolv</a> was designed to lower your utilization.  
            </li>
            <li>
              If you only have one type of credit account (either revolving or installment), it’s good to add another type to improve your credit mix. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">The most important thing, regardless of the types of accounts you have, is to pay them on time!  Payment history is the largest factor in your credit score. </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">A secured credit card can be a good way to build revolving credit. If you’re having a hard time getting an unsecured card, you’ll need a cash deposit to open one. Your secured credit card works just like a regular credit card, meaning you pay high interest on the balance you carry, and you need to manage your utilization, so you don’t hurt your score.  </p> 
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">CreditStrong offers solutions to build installment and revolving credit without needing to put down a large deposit, and because Revolv can only be spent on your savings account, you can build payment history by saving, not spending.   </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">That’s okay! Occasionally, adding a new line of credit to your profile will cause a slight temporary dip in your score because it reduces your overall age of credit history. In these cases, it’s typical for your score to quickly rebound and increase as on-time payments are reported. </p>
